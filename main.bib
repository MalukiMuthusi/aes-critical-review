  abstract = {We show that there is a very straightforward closed algebraic formula for the Rijndael block cipher. This formula is highly structured and far simpler then algebraic formulations of any other block cipher we know. The security of Rijndael depends on a new and untested hardness assumption: it is computationally infeasible to solve equations of this type. The lack of research on this new assumption raises concerns over the wisdom of using Rijndael for security-critical applications.},

It explains the mathematics needed to understand the operation of Rijndael, and it provides reference C code and test vectors for the cipher"--Page [v].
